# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This project is a workday scheduler that allows users to save events for each hour of a working day. The scheduler will grab any saved schedule items from local storage and populate them into the corresponding timeslot. This scheduler also gets the time from your computer, and adds a class to the time block depending on what time of day it currently is.
